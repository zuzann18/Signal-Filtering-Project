Battery Signal Analysis for "Coup de Fouet" Phenomenon
Project Description
This repository is dedicated to the analysis of the "coup de fouet" (whiplash effect) observed during the charge and discharge cycles of batteries. It contains MATLAB scripts designed to process highly noisy signal data, extract meaningful information, and identify characteristic features of the "coup de fouet" phenomenon, such as the dip, bump, and plateau in voltage curves.

Objectives
Implement signal processing methods to mitigate noise and extract features from battery voltage curves.
